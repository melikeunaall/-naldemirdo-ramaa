/**
 * The Cloudflare Worker entry — the app's SSR error boundary of last resort.
 *
 * `wrangler.jsonc` points `main` here instead of straight at
 * `@tanstack/react-start/server-entry`, so every server-rendered request
 * passes through this file. Its job: if rendering fails in a way the
 * framework itself does not handle, the visitor still gets a branded 500
 * page (never a raw stack trace, never a blank screen) and the real error
 * still reaches the logs.
 *
 * Scope, stated precisely because it drives what belongs here:
 *   - Route/loader errors are ALREADY handled by TanStack Router's own
 *     error boundary (verified: a throwing loader renders the app shell
 *     with a 500 and leaks nothing). Those never reach this catch.
 *   - What DOES reach it: a failure importing or invoking the server
 *     entry itself, and any throw that escapes the framework entirely.
 *
 * The entry is imported LAZILY and memoized: a module-level import would
 * run framework initialization before this file's error handling is in
 * place, which is exactly when an unguarded crash hurts most.
 *
 * Note the handler call passes ONLY the request. The framework's second
 * parameter is `RequestOptions` (early hints, inline CSS, request
 * context) — NOT the Worker's `env`/`ctx`, which reach app code through
 * `cloudflare:workers` instead. Forwarding `env` here would push a
 * bindings object into a slot that means something else entirely.
